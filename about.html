                    <p id="first">I am a recent graduate of Temple University who now works as a Software Engineer for Tata Consultancy Services. While at Temple, I receivced a Bachelors Degree in Information Science and Technology.</p>
                    <p>The biggest project I undertook during my time at Temple would be my senior Capstone which was a two-semester project in which I and a team of 4 other Temple IS&T majors created a change management system for Temple's Student Collaboration Center. This involved the creation of different client deliverables and client meetings to deliver a web service that allows users and admins to submit and modify change requests. Using ASP.NET and other services to create the webpage and database that will provide the service.</p>

            <p>During the summer of 2019 I studied and interned abroad as apart of Temple's Japan program. While there, I interned for Tokyo Academic's subsidiary company, Tokyo Coding Club, as a curriculum development intern. I have also interned for three summers at Rodriguez Consulting LLC. as a data entry intern and surveyor, working with such programs as Zoho CRM, Google Drive, and MapTiler to name a few.</p>
            <p>Through my academic career so far I have picked up technical skills in Java, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and C#. Through both my professional and educational experience so far, I feel I have a solid base understanding of multiple coding languages and have learned several workplace skills such as, time management, multitasking, and how to properly communicate with others on a project to be as proficient as possible. </p>
